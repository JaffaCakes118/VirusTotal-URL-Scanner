**Privacy Policy for VirusTotal URL Scanner Add-on**

This Privacy Policy describes how the "VirusTotal URL Scanner" Firefox Add-on ("the Add-on") collects, uses, and shares information.

**1. Data Collection and Use**

The Add-on is designed to enhance your Browse security by automatically scanning visited URLs with VirusTotal. To achieve this, the Add-on collects and processes the following information:

* **Visited URLs**: When you navigate to a new webpage, the Add-on captures the URL of that page. This URL is then sent to the VirusTotal API for analysis. The Add-on maintains a local queue of URLs to be scanned and a list of recently completed scans.
* **VirusTotal API Key**: To use the Add-on, you must provide your personal VirusTotal API Key. This key is stored locally within your browser's add-on storage and is used to authenticate your requests to the VirusTotal API. The Add-on verifies the API key by making a request to the VirusTotal API.
* **Scan Results**: The results of the VirusTotal scans (e.g., number of malicious detections, total engines) are received from the VirusTotal API and are displayed within the Add-on's popup interface. These results are also stored locally in your browser's add-on storage as part of the "completed scans" list.
* **Whitelisted Domains**: You have the option to add domains to a whitelist. URLs belonging to whitelisted domains will not be sent to VirusTotal for scanning. This list is stored locally.
* **User Consent**: The Add-on records your consent to its privacy and terms of service. This consent status is stored locally.
* **Theme Preference**: Your chosen theme preference (dark/light mode) is stored locally.

**The Add-on does not collect, store, or transmit any personally identifiable information (PII) such as your name, email address, or Browse history (beyond the URLs explicitly sent to VirusTotal for scanning as described above) to the developer or any third parties other than VirusTotal.**

**2. Information Sharing**

* **VirusTotal API**: The primary function of this Add-on involves sending the URLs you visit to the VirusTotal API (provided by Google SecOps) for security analysis. By using this Add-on, you acknowledge and agree to VirusTotal's (Google SecOps) Privacy Notice and Terms of Service. Please review their policies directly:
    * VirusTotal Privacy Notice: [https://cloud.google.com/terms/secops/privacy-notice](https://cloud.google.com/terms/secops/privacy-notice)
    * VirusTotal Terms of Service: [https://cloud.google.com/terms/secops](https://cloud.google.com/terms/secops)
* **Local Storage**: All other data mentioned above (API key, scan results, whitelisted domains, consent, theme preference, scan queue, completed scans) is stored **only locally within your browser's add-on storage**. This data is not accessible by the Add-on developer or any other third party.

**3. Data Security**

The Add-on stores your VirusTotal API key and other local data within the secure `browser.storage.local` API, which is a private storage area for the Add-on and generally inaccessible by other add-ons or websites. We implement reasonable technical and organizational measures designed to protect the information stored locally within the Add-on.

**4. Changes to This Privacy Policy**

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy within the Add-on's listing on the Firefox Browser ADD-ONS website. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.

**5. Contact Us**
